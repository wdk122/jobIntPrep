SORTING ALGORITHMS REVIEW



INSERTION SORT

This insertion sort function separates an array into a sorted part on the left and an unsorted part on the right. Initially the unsorted part is empty, and items are removed from the unsorted part and inserted one at a time into the correct place in the sorted part. 

Given the array below:
[2, 8, 3, 6, 4, 1, 5, 7, 9, 0]

The function iterates through array[1] to the last element, using a subroutine to insert the elements into the correct places. The main loop stores the current index i's value to a placeholder variable and initiates an inner loop.

The inner loop checks if the current value is greater than the previous value; while this case is false, the inner loop performs a series of swaps to get the current value into the sorted position.

The given array mutates as follows:

[2, 8, 3, 6, 4, 1, 5, 7, 9, 0]
[2, 3, 8, 6, 4, 1, 5, 7, 9, 0]
[2, 3, 6, 8, 4, 1, 5, 7, 9, 0]
[2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 1, 5, 7, 9, 0]
[1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 5, 7, 9, 0]

etc...
